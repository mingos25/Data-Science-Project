# Data Science Project
In this project, a dataset related to customer satisfaction of an airline will be analyzed.

Initially, an exploratory analysis of the dataset will be performed to determine whether the problem is classification or regression. The balance of target values will be assessed. The dataset size, type and present values of features will also be examined.

Data preprocessing will then be performed, which includes cleaning null values and removing features that are not essential for analysis.

Next, feature engineering will be performed, implementing the solutions devised during the data exploration phase.

During the data exploration phase, outliers in the dataset will be identified and managed.

It will then proceed to data standardization and feature selection, where statistical methods will be used to select the most significant and relevant features.

After this, appropriate metrics will be defined and chosen based on the nature of the problem addressed.

The learning models to be used will then be defined, exploring two avenues:

- analysis on all features of the dataset
- analysis on relevant features of the dataset.

For each road, a quick preliminary analysis will be performed on the chosen models(spot check). The two best models will be subjected to hyperparameter tuning on the training set and tested on the test set. In the end, the results of both roads will be compared and the one with the highest accuracy will be chosen.

**The ultimate goal is to predict user satisfaction based on the parameters of the services offered by the airline**
